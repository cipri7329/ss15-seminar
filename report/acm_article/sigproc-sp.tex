% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

\title{Distributed File Systems: \\Hadoop Distributed File System and Google File System}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.

\begin{abstract}
Distributed file systems have been a technology enabler to store and process large files which exceed the size of any drive. They also work in a distributed and fail tolerant manner. The first and most known implementations are Google File System and Hadoop Distributed File System.

% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
During the late 90s the Y2K issue was a popular topic in media, but together with the 2000s a bigger and more silent issue took its place. 
The rise of internet traffic, saving and processing every online footprint, having countless of sensors pouring out data into databases and then the rise of the smartphone to a omnipresence status meant that thousands of terabytes and petabytes of data were being generated daily. 
This became a problem due to multiple reasons. Firstly, there was no big enough storage medium to store all the data in a single physical location, and secondly processing such amount of data in order to extract valuable information became an even bigger challenge. Even if there were enough space to store huge amounts of data on a single drive, only seeking through such amount of data would be prohibitive in terms of access times. In this context a new IT domain was born - Big Data. 


The requirements 

Store very large data sets reliably
High bandwidth streaming
Distribute storage
Distribute computation
Analysis and transformation of data

The solution
Moving computation where data resides
Low costs - commodity machines
Vertical and Horizontal scalability
