Slides:

1 - What is gfs
distributed filesystem from google


2 - where is it used
component failures are the norm
files are huge
files are appended, not overwritten
files are mostly sequentially read

3 - how does it work - overview
one master - many chunkservers
files are split into chunks
chunks are distributed over chunkservers
replicates?

4 - advantages/disadvantages?
